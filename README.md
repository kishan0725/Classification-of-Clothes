Image classification is used in several applications, ranging from recognising life-threatening illnesses in medical scans to detecting hotdogs in selfies.

Researchers at Zalando (the e-commerce company) have developed a new image classification dataset called Fashion MNIST in hopes of replacing MNIST. This new dataset contains images of various articles of clothing and accessories â€” such as shirts, bags, shoes, and other fashion items.
